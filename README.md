# Objective
- What is the key pain point?
The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

- What is the ideal solution?
To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their:
  - subscriber count
  - total views
  - total videos, and
  - engagement metrics
 
This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

## User story
As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK .

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.
